# Cognifyz-Technology
This repository contains my internship tasks completed during the Java Development Internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The tasks are categorized into three levels, with increasing complexity, to demonstrate my understanding of Java programming, problem-solving, and software development skills.


ðŸŸ¦ Level 1 â€“ Beginner Java Projects
These tasks focus on basic Java programming concepts such as input/output handling, loops, conditions, and basic data structures. Ideal for building a strong foundation.

ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Temperature Converter
Description:
Create a console-based application that converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user is prompted to enter the temperature and the unit, and the program calculates and displays the converted result.
Skills Used: Input/output handling, arithmetic operations, conditional statements.

ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Palindrome Checker
Description:
Develop a program that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring spaces/punctuation).
Skills Used: String manipulation, loops, conditionals.

ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Student Grade Calculator
Description:
Build a program that calculates the average grade of a student. The user inputs the number of grades and each individual grade. The program calculates and displays the average.
Skills Used: Arrays, loops, arithmetic operations.

ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Random Password Generator
Description:
Design a utility that generates a secure random password. The user specifies the desired length and whether to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
Skills Used: Random number generation, string handling, user input.


ðŸŸ¨ Level 2 â€“ Intermediate Java Projects
These projects require more logic and involve file handling, validations, and working with structured data.

ðŸ”¸ Task 1: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Description:
Create a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game board is displayed, and each player takes turns making a move. The game checks for a win or draw after each turn and allows for replay.
Skills Used: Arrays, conditional logic, loops, 2D arrays.

ðŸ”¸ Task 2: Password Strength Checker
Description:
Write a program that evaluates the strength of a password based on its length and presence of different character types. Provides feedback such as "Weak", "Moderate", or "Strong".
Skills Used: String handling, validation logic, conditions.

ðŸ”¸ Task 3: File Encryption/Decryption
Description:
Develop a tool that encrypts or decrypts a text file using a basic algorithm (e.g., Caesar cipher). The user can choose between encrypt/decrypt and provide a file path.
Skills Used: File handling, string processing, basic encryption logic.


ðŸŸ¥ Level 3 â€“ Advanced Java Projects
These are real-world, application-level projects involving networking, multithreading, GUI, or APIs.

ðŸ”º Task 1: Chat Application
Description:
Develop a simple client-server chat application using Java Sockets or Java NIO. Users can send and receive messages in real time.
Skills Used: Socket programming, client-server model, threading.
